        <h2>Brooklyn Bridge</h2>
        <p>The bridge's appearance sets it apart: its Gothic towers with double arches, criss-crossing steel cables and
            graceful, gentle curvature make walking or biking across the span (or at least catching a glimpse of it)
            sought-after experiences for visitors. On either end are cool neighborhoods to explore: stately Brooklyn
            Heights and once-industrial DUMBO on the Brooklyn side; the Financial District, TriBeCa and Chinatown all
            within easy reach on the Manhattan side.</p>

        <h2>History of Cabs in New York City</h2>
        <p>In the early 19th century, swanky horse-drawn hansom cabs often driven by African-Americans or newly arrived
            Irish immigrants carried well-heeled New Yorkers from place to place. Then in the 1920s, John Hertz founded
            the Yellow Cab Company, and it dominated the taxi world, and that's why yellow is synonymous with a taxi
            today. Yellow Cab Company was ultimately bought by the Checker Cab Company, and it led the industry for
            years to come. In the 1950s, New York City was swarming with cab companies, and the taxi as icon of NYC was
            born. In the 1970s, NYC cabs, like the city itself, were on a downward spiral. They were dirty, with
            cigarette butts, chewed gum, and paper cups littering the seats. In 1970, yellow became the official color
            of all NYC medallion taxis. By the 2000s, taxis had cleaned up their act and added minivans and SUVs to the
            mix of cars to accommodate more passengers comfortably.</p>
        <p>Then in the 2010s Uber and then Lyft shook up the taxi world with their apps and cheaper fares. The cab
            companies have responded with apps of their own that give riders the same convenience as Uber and Lyft but
            with insured and licensed taxi drivers.</p>

        <h2>Why is New York City Called The Big Apple?</h2>
        <p>There have been many ideas about how New York came to be called “The Big Apple.” Some say it comes from the
            former well-to-do families that sold apples on New York City streets to make ends meet during the Great
            Depression. Another account says that the term comes from a famous nineteenth century brothel madam named
            Eve whose girls were cheekily referred to as her “Big Apples.” But the nickname actually springs from a
            catchphrase used in the 1920s by New York Morning Telegraph sports writer John J. Fitz Gerald in his horse
            racing column, “Around the Big Apple.” Starting on February 18, 1924, he began the every column with the
            header, “The Big Apple. The dream of every lad that ever threw a leg over a thoroughbred and the goal of all
            horsemen. There's only one Big Apple. That's New York.”</p>
